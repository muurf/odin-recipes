        <h2> <strong>What is a New-York Style Cheesecake?</strong></h2>
        <p> New York-style cheesecake is larger and richer than traditional cheesecake, 
            thanks to the additions of cream cheese and more egg yolks. 
            Some recipes, like this one, feature sour cream to make the 
            dessert even more <em>decadent</em>.</p>
